{"name":"Grapholed","tagline":"A diagramming software for the Graphol language","body":"## pyGraphol\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGrapholed is diagramming software for the Graphol language written in python. [Graphol] is developed by \r\nmembers  of the DASI-lab group  of the [Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica \"A.Ruberti\"] at [Sapienza] \r\nUniversity of Rome. Graphol offers a  completely visual representation of ontologies to users, in \r\norder to help understanding by people who are not skilled in logic. Graphol provides designers with \r\nsimple graphical primitives for ontology editing, avoiding complex textual syntax. Graphol's basic \r\ncomponents are inspired by Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams, thus ontologies that can be rendered as \r\nER diagrams have in Graphol a similar diagrammatic shape.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. \r\nFor more information see the LICENSE file included with the distribution.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n* [Source code](https://github.com/danielepantaleone/grapholed)\r\n* [Bug tracker](https://github.com/danielepantaleone/grapholed/issues)\r\n* [Graphol website](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~graphol/)\r\n* [Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica \"A.Ruberti\"](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en)\r\n* [Sapienza University](http://en.uniroma1.it/)\r\n\r\n[Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica \"A.Ruberti\"]: http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/en\r\n[Sapienza]: http://en.uniroma1.it/\r\n[Graphol]: http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~graphol/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
